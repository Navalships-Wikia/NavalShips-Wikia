# NavalShips-Wikia
This is a basic Wikipedia project of Naval Ships in fleets from around the World. I hope to expand this with more pages and ship details in the coming moments.

If you would like to contribute, please email me. You will need to have knowledge of HTML/CSS and GitHub for commits/pulls since this is a static website. Research expertise in warships is also required, which can be time-intensive.

For now, please leave any suggestions you may have in the Discussions of this repository!
