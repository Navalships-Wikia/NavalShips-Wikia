                    Welcome to the <i>NavalShips Wikia</i>, a site that serves as an informative Wikipedia for naval ships in fleets worldwide! From the past to the present, we are documenting them all.
                    Feel free to explore and start your research on any fleet ships that interest you. Please do note that this Wiki is currently not yet fully optimized for mobile devices,
                    it may be best to view the website on a laptop or desktop PC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the Wiki focuses on ships mainly from the World War 2 era. If you have any questions, please visit the Contact Me page.

                    If you would like to contribute, please email me. You will need to have knowledge of HTML/CSS and GitHub for commits/pulls since this is a static website.
                    Research expertise in warships is also required, which can be time-intensive.
