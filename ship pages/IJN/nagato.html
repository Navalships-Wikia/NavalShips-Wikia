                    <h2>Brief History Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        The IJN Nagato is a Super-Dreadnought class battleship built for the Japanese Navy in 1920 which at the time, she was designed to be the leading ship of her class. 
                        The ship has participated in several conflicts such as the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and also served as Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's Flagship during the Attack on Pearl Harbor. 
                        Later in her life, from 1934-1936 she was modernized with several improvements to armor and a rebuild of her superstructure.

                    <p>
                        She spent most of her time in the Pacific War training in Japan's territorial waters. She only saw combat starting in 1944 with the Battle of the Philippine Sea when she was attacked by American aircraft. 
                        At the end of World War II, she was the only Japanese Capital Battleship to have survived, even though there was an American campaign to destroy the IJN's remaining capital ships. She went on to serve as a target in nuclear trials during Operation Crossroads. 
                        She was sunk during the second trial.

                    <h2>Ship Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the time, Nagato's length sat at around 201.17 meters (600 ft) between the perpendiculars, 215.8 meters in total. She has a beam of 29.02 meters while her draft was 9.08 meters. 
                        She displaced a total of 32,720 metric tons at her standard load, increasing to a total of 39,116 metric tons at full load. Her crew complement was 1,333 sailors initially, 
                        this increased as time went by, in 1944, it had reached 1,734 sailors. By 1930, she was remodeled in order to reduce water spray that occured when steaming into a headsea. 
                        This had increased her length by 1.59 meters (5 ft 3 in). She was once again lengthened further by another 7.55 meters (24.8 ft) during her 1934-36 reconstruction. This process improved her speed.
                        She also had new torpedo bulges added in order to improve her underwater protection and as a compensatory factor from the addition weight the additional armour has added.

                    <h2>Propulsion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nagato was equipped with four Gihon steam turbines, each of these drove a single propeller shaft. The propulsion system was designed to produce a whopping 80,000 shp (60,000 kW) by using steam from the 
                        21 Kampon water tube biolders, of which 15 were oil fired whilst the reamining consumed a mix of both coal and oil. This allowed her a range of up to 5,500 nautical miles when cruising at a speed of 16 knots.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In 1922, it has been said that the funnel smoke would often choke and blind the crew commanding the ship from the bridge, in order to prevent this, they had to install a "fingernail" shaped deflector on her fore 
                        funnel to direct the smoke elsewhere. Unfortunately, this proved ineffective and they tried once again by this time rebuilding the fore funnel in a serpentine shape in 1924. Then, in 1930, this funnel was completely
                        eliminated when all the boilers were replaced by just ten oil fired Kampon boilers. With these changes, she could store addition fuel in her torpedo bulges which has allowed for an increased range up to 8,560 nautical 
                        miles at her 16 knot speed.
                    </p>
