                <h2>Brief History Summary</h2>
                <p>The IJN Nagato is a Super-Dreadnought classed battleship built for the Japanese Navy in 1920. She was designed to be the leading ship of her class. She participated in several conflicts such as the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and also served as Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's Flagship during the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Later in her life, from 1934-1936 she was modernized with several improvements to armor and a rebuild of her superstructure.</p>

                <p>She spent most of her time in the Pacific War training in Japan's territorial waters. She only saw combat starting in 1944 with the Battle of the Philippine Sea when she was attacked by American aircraft. At the end of World War 2, she was the only Japanese Capital Battleship to have survived, even though there was an American campaign to destroy the IJN's remaining capital ships. She went on to serve as a target in nuclear trials during Operation Crossroads. She was sunk during the second trial.</p>
